# gatsby-starter-markdown-blog
Starter with the essentials needed for a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) site that can process markdown files in local file system. This is built by following steps outlined in https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-four/

Install this starter (assuming Gatsby is installed) by running from your CLI:
```
gatsby new gatsby-site https://github.com/phanikandula/gatsby-starter-markdown-blog
```

## Running in development
`gatsby develop`

Urls for markdown related files are generated using the file names.

## Next steps
Once the stater site is up, next steps would be:

1. update site title in gatsby-config.js
2. remove *.md files and my-files.js in src/pages
3. make the blog yours with your markdown files.
